# げんき Study Resources

## Project Abstract
_At least one paragraph description of the overall project. Include a UML use case diagram or other helpful diagram._ 

げんき (Genki) Study Resources is an open source web app for studying Japanese alongside the げんき textbook
owned and maintained by [Seth Clydesdale](https://github.com/SethClydesdale) as well as other contributors. 
It contains some of the content from each of the lessons in げんき including the vocab and grammar, but not the lessons themselves.
It is merely meant as a supplemental tool for practice alongside the textbook itself. 
Thus, the use case is mainly for people who have gone through the lesson in the textbook and done the speaking, reading, and writing practice there, but still want more practice outside of that.


## Project Relevance
_A one paragraph explanation of how the proposal is linked to the educational goals of this class and why this goal is important goal (see list of subject in Initial Survey or slide 7 and 8 in CIS3296Introduction.pptx)_

## Conceptual Design
_A one-paragraph description of your proposed contribution._

I mainly want to add some game element to this app with a scoring system that people can use to practice. 
It takes countless hours of practice to learn a new language and Japanese is among the hardest to learn, there are literally thousands of characters you have to memorize.
Simply doing drag and drop or multiple choice quizzes for all of those characters gets boring pretty quick, so I want to make it more enjoyable. 
I am currently thinking along the lines of a typing game and a card memorization game, but I am open to any and all suggestions.
<br>

I also want to make numerous quality of life imporvements throughout the app, mainly the organization and navigation. 
Currently it is just a long list of links and tons of index.html pages, so I hope to make it more user friendly.
Also, the third edition of the げんき textbook was released last year, leading the creator to branch off into having two seperate versions within the same repo.
There seems to be many things they have worked on and only implemented in the third edition, even though both editions have the same JS source files. 
Thus, I would like to update and maintain the second edition so people without access to the third edition textbook can make use of these new features.
